        <p class="text-style">Founded in 1995 by Sarah Crane, Someliers has grown from a one-woman
            endeavor into a thriving team of six passionate individuals. Sarah's journey began with a vision to bring a
            touch of excellence to every event through the art of wine selection and pairing.
            What started as a solo venture has now blossomed into a dedicated team of experts, all sharing a common
            goal: to make your events truly extraordinary. Our team understands that it's not just about food and wine;
            it's about people, connections, and creating moments that last a lifetime.

                    Our commitment goes beyond just pairing wine with food; we tailor each selection to match the
                    individual and their specific needs. We believe that it's these personal touches that illuminate any
                    event, adding a touch of brilliance and making it truly memorable.
                    At Someliers, we make your events shine by turning wine into an art that connects people and
                    transforms ordinary moments into extraordinary memories.
